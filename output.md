###### Annual Report 2022


-----

### Highlights Downer’s Urban Services businesses performed
###### well in FY22. Despite positive underlying core markets, earnings were weighed down by the disruptive impacts of COVID-19 and severe wet weather on operations. Downer reported a statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) of $152.0 million, and an underlying NPATA of $225.3 million. Cash performance remains strong, with cash conversion of 83.9% (underlying cash conversion of 88.9%[1]). Downer’s performance, and the continued strength of the balance sheet, has resulted in the Board declaring a final dividend of 12 cents per share, taking total dividends for the year to 24 cents per share (up 3 cents per share on prior year), unfranked.
